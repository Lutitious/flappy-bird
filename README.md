# Simple Flappy Bird Game

## Project Overview
This project is a simple flappy bird implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play a game where they control a bird that must navigate through pipes without hitting them. The game includes features like changing bird skins, backgrounds, and pipe colours.

## Files Included
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the game page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the game and its elements.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file where the game logic and interactivity are implemented.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to play the game.
3. Edit `main.js` to add new features or change the game logic as you learn.
4. Modify `styles.css` to update the look and feel of the game.

## Usage
- Open `index.html` in your browser to start the game.
- Refresh the page after making changes to the code to see your updates in action.
